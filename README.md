This purpose of this program is to simulate a game of blackjack. You are playing against the dealer, who is a computer. The goal of the game is to either get 21 or the closest to it, but you must also not go past 21. Each card has a value associated to it: numbered cards represent the same amount of points as their numbers, figures have a value of 10 and aces can either be 1 or 11, whatever is the most advantageous for you. At first, you receive two cards and you are shown one card in the dealerâ€™s hand. The program then offers you two options, to either hit or stand. If you hit, the program will generate a new card and you will have a new amount of points. It will also check if you have gone over the limit of 21 points. You can hit as much as you want and after you are at a comfortable amount of points and you think that it is enough for you to win, you can enter stand. Then, the full hand of the dealer will be shown. He will keep hitting until he gets an amount of points bigger or equal to 16. Finally, the program will automatically calculate how many points both players have and whoever is closest to 21 wins!
